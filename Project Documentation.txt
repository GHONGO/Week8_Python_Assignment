Project Documentation

Overview:
The CORD-19 Data Explorer is a comprehensive Streamlit application that allows users to explore and analyze metadata from COVID-19 research papers. It implements all the requirements from the step-by-step tasks, providing interactive visualizations and insights into publication trends.

Implementation Details:

Data Loading: The app loads sample data that mimics the structure of the actual CORD-19 metadata.csv file.

Data Cleaning:

Handles missing values in author fields
Converts publish time to datetime format
Extracts publication year for time based analysis
Creates new columns like abstract word count

Data Analysis:

Counts publications by year
Identifies top journals
Analyzes word frequency in titles
Calculates basic statistics

Visualization:

Bar chart of publications over time
Horizontal bar chart of top journal
Word frequency chart
Abstract word count distribution
Word cloud of paper titles

Streamlit App:

Interactive filters for year range and journal selection
Metric cards showing key statistics
Data sample display
Comprehensive documentation section


Reflection
Challenges Faced:

Data Simulation: Creating realistic sample data that represents the actual CORD-19 dataset structure
Visualization Clarity: Ensuring charts are informative and easy to understand
Layout Design: Creating an intuitive user interface with proper section organization
Performance Considerations: Designing the app to handle potential large datasets efficiently


Solutions Implemented:

Used a structured approach to create representative sample data
Applied consistent styling and clear labels to all visualizations
Organized the app into logical sections with clear headers
Implemented filtering to handle data subsets efficiently
